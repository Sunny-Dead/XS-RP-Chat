XSChat
XSChat is a local chat mod designed specifically for DayZ role-playing servers. This mod enhances in-game communication by allowing players to seamlessly switch between three distinct chat channels—DIRECT, OOC, and ACTION—using simple key presses. Messages sent on each channel are automatically prefixed and color-coded: DIRECT messages appear in white, OOC messages in Maroon Red, and ACTION messages in Bright Blue. In addition, the active channel indicator is appended to the sender’s name, making it easy for everyone to immediately discern whether a message is in-character dialogue, out-of-character commentary, or an action description.

By clearly differentiating the types of chat messages, XSChat helps maintain role-play boundaries and ensures that important narrative cues are not lost in generic chat. The mod is fully local-only, meaning it operates without broadcasting messages to other players, making it ideal for servers that prioritize immersive, self-contained RP communication. XSChat was developed with inspiration from established chat systems and is tailored to meet the unique needs of the role-playing community.

Features
Channel Switching:

DIRECT: Standard chat with no extra prefix (white).
OOC: Out-of-character chat automatically prefixed with "OOC" (Maroon Red).
ACTION: Action descriptions automatically prefixed with "ACTION" (Bright Blue).
Dynamic Channel Indicator:
The active channel is appended to the sender’s name, so all players can easily see which channel a message is coming from.

Adjustable Font Size:
Easily adjust the chat font size with simple keybinds for optimal readability.

Configure Settings:
XSChat uses JSON files (stored in $profile:XSChat) for color and font size settings. You can modify these files to change the appearance of chat messages.

Keybind Instructions
Z Key:
Press Z to cycle through the available chat channels. The channels cycle in the following order:
DIRECT → OOC → ACTION → DIRECT. When you toggle, a system message is displayed in chat—e.g., "You swapped to OOC channel"—using the corresponding channel color.

[ Key:
Press the [ key to decrease the chat font size.

] Key:
Press the ] key to increase the chat font size.

These keybinds help ensure that you can quickly adjust your chat settings and always know which channel you are using.

Usage
When you type a message, the mod automatically applies a prefix based on the active channel:

DIRECT:
No additional prefix is added. The message appears as you type it.
OOC:
The message is automatically prefixed with -> OOC and displays in Maroon Red. In the chat line, the sender’s name is appended with OOC.
ACTION:
The message is automatically prefixed with -> ACTION and displays in Bright Blue. In the chat line, the sender’s name is appended with ACTION.
These prefixes and color codes are set in the XSChat settings files and can be adjusted as needed.

Acknowledgments
This mod was developed with inspiration from an established global chat system by Schana. His work provided valuable insights into effective chat channel design and functionality in DayZ. While his implementation served as a conceptual reference, every aspect of XSChat has been reworked and tailored to meet the unique needs of our role-playing community.
